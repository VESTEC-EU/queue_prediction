abstract = {Several companies and research institutes are moving their CPU-inten
sive applications to hybrid High Performance Computing (HPC) cloud environments.
 Such a shift depends on the creation of software systems that help users decide
 where a job should be placed considering execution time and queue wait time to 
access on-premise clusters. Relying blindly on turnaround prediction techniques 
will affect negatively response times inside HPC cloud environments. This paper 
introduces a tool to make job placement decisions in HPC hybrid cloud environmen
ts taking into account the inaccuracy of execution and waiting time predictions.
 We used job traces from real supercomputing centers to run our experiments, and
 compared the performance between environments using real speedup curves. We als
o extended a state-of-the-art machine learning based predictor to work with data
 from the cluster scheduler. Our main findings are as follows: (i) depending on 
workload characteristics, there is a turning point where predictions should be d
isregarded in favor of a more conservative decision to minimize job turnaround t
imes and (ii) scheduler data plays a key role in improving predictions generated
 with machine learning using job trace data—our experiments showed around 20% pr
ediction accuracy improvements.}

result in up to 64{\%} higher overall prediction accuracy than existing methods.

abstract = {Summary Production parallel systems are space-shared, and resource allocation on such systems is usually performed using a batch queue scheduler. Jobs submitted to the batch queue experience a variable delay before the requested resources are granted. Predicting this delay can assist users in planning experiment time-frames and choosing sites with less turnaround times and can also help meta-schedulers make scheduling decisions. In this paper, we present an integrated adaptive framework, Qespera, for prediction of queue waiting times on parallel systems. We propose a novel algorithm based on spatial clustering for predictions using history of job submissions and executions. The framework uses adaptive set of strategies for choosing either distributions or summary of features to represent the system state and to compare with history jobs, varying the weights associated with the features for each job prediction, and selecting a particular algorithm dynamically for performing the prediction depending on the characteristics of the target and history jobs. Our experiments with real workload traces from different production systems demonstrate up to 22\% reduction in average absolute error and up to 56\% reduction in percentage prediction error over existing techniques. We also report prediction errors of less than 1 h for a majority of the jobs. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
